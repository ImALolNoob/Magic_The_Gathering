## Install/Setup
- Install Google's Tesseract on your system (TODO: Add notes on variant)
- Download "AllPrintings.sqlite" database at https://mtgjson.com/downloads/all-files/ and put into root folder



## Dependencies
`requirements.txt` is generated by `pip3 freeze` -- this may be very wrong.

Install dependencies manually via:
- `pip3 install requests colorama opencv-python pillow pytesseract tqdm`



## Other notes
If you are using pylint on Linux, and it's not using modules from your venv, execute the following in terminal:
- export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/dir-to-your-project/.venv/lib64/python3.11/site-packages/`

<!-- test ci/cd pylint -->
